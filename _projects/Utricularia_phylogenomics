[cite_start]Carnivory in plants has evolved across various lineages, including the genus *Utricularia*[cite: 192]. [cite_start]Brazil and Colombia are key centers of diversity for this genus, but a lack of comprehensive studies has led to an underestimation of their conservation status[cite: 193, 194].

[cite_start]This study investigates the genetic diversity and reconstructs the evolutionary and biogeographic relationships of *Utricularia foliosa* and *U. gibba* populations using Genotype-by-Sequencing (GBS)[cite: 199]. [cite_start]Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that *U. foliosa* populations cluster by geographic location[cite: 201]. [cite_start]*U. gibba* populations showed more complex structuring[cite: 202]. [cite_start]These findings highlight the genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships within *Utricularia* populations, and the gene flow observed across large distances emphasizes the potential role of avian-mediated dispersal[cite: 205, 206].
