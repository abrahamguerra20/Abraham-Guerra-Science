[cite_start]This project aimed to assess the environmental potential and health risks associated with the mineral water wells in the municipality of Usiacurí, Colombia[cite: 228]. [cite_start]The work involved evaluating the quality and safety of the water, considering both natural factors and human activities that may affect the water sources[cite: 229].

[cite_start]We investigated the microbiological and chemical composition of the water to identify any health risks related to contaminants, including pathogens and toxic substances[cite: 230, 232]. [cite_start]The results contribute to the formulation of policies and practices for ensuring a safe water supply and promoting environmental conservation in the region[cite: 233].
