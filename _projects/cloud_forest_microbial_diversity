[cite_start]The montane cloud forest is among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide, facing disturbances from deforestation and climate change[cite: 219, 220]. [cite_start]While microbial communities regulate nutrient cycles in the soil, their diversity in this ecosystem remains largely unknown[cite: 221].

[cite_start]In this study, we evaluated the diversity and structure of bacterial and fungal communities associated with the soil around iconic plant species (*Cyatheaceae* and *Juglandaceae*) in a pristine montane cloud forest in Mexico[cite: 222]. [cite_start]Our results revealed a high prevalence of entomopathogenic fungi like *Tolypocladium geodes* and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria such as *Pseudomonas* and *Bacillus* spp[cite: 223]. [cite_start]These results are crucial for developing in-situ conservation strategies to preserve microbial functions[cite: 225].
