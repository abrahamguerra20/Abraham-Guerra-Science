[cite_start]This study characterizes the genome and functionality of *Lactiplantibacillus plantarum* HCA1, a lactic acid bacterium isolated from pig manure, focusing on its probiotic potential and bacteriocin production[cite: 179]. [cite_start]Genome sequencing revealed a circular chromosome of 3.28 Mb [cite: 180][cite_start], and comparative genomics showed high similarity with other *L. plantarum* strains, suggesting conserved probiotic functions[cite: 181].

[cite_start]Notably, HCA1 harbors various plantaricin genes (K, J, N, A, E, and F), which contribute to its antimicrobial activity[cite: 182]. [cite_start]Genes associated with acid and bile salt tolerance, along with epithelial cell adhesion, were also identified, enhancing its probiotic value[cite: 183]. [cite_start]Pangenomic analysis revealed an open pangenome, indicative of genomic plasticity[cite: 187]. [cite_start]These findings position HCA1 as a promising strain for gut health applications and food preservation[cite: 189].
